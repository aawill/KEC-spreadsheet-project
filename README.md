KEC podcast analytics tool
Written by Aaron Willette aawill@umich.edu

This software is still in early development, there may be bugs present.

Directions:

1. Save a copy of the Retina Podcast Analytics spreadsheet as a .csv file on the desktop

2. Go to canvas analytics->media, click the 'plus' for a video, and choose to "export to csv".

3. Save the csv file on your desktop, and give it a name that matches its name in the left column of the main analytics spreadsheet. Should be something like Elner 1a, Comer 1c, etc.

4. Run the program, and follow the directions! Make sure your input exactly matches the filename you want to open - leave off the ".csv", though.

Note - in the current implementation, there are certain strict formatting requirements for our main analytics .xlsx file. Some important ones:

	- empty spaces must be filled by zeros (0)

	- video names cannot have spaces before/after them in the 		  cell

	- data not used for analytics (dates and colors, resident 	    	  names + years, etc) must be confined to the top two rows
